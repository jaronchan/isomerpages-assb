### **Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards for Statutory Board**

The Accounting Standards Act 2007 ("Act") was passed in Parliament on 27 August 2007 and came into effect on 1 November 2007. The Act established the Accounting Standards Council ("ASC") and appointed the Accountant-General as the legal authority to prescribe accounting standards for Statutory Boards.

Every Statutory Board specified in the First Schedule of the Act shall prepare its financial statements in compliance with the accounting standards established by the Accountant-General.

To bring wider representation and experience into the standards setting process, the Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards for Statutory Boards ("Advisory Committee") has been formed to advise the Accountant-General. The Advisory Committee comprises representatives from various stakeholders such as the Statutory Boards, the public accounting profession, the accounting academia and the Government.

The objective of the Advisory Committee is to advise the Accountant-General in prescribing high quality accounting standards for use by Statutory Boards in Singapore in the preparation of their financial statements, taking into account:

* The unique characteristics of Statutory Boards, which are constituted under Acts of Parliament and are therefore statutorily accountable to Parliament;
* Facilitation of comparability, disclosure and transparency; and
* Comparability with relevant international standards.


### **History**

Prior to 2003, Statutory Boards were guided by the Auditor-General's Office's paper "Uniformity in Accounting Treatment and Presentation of Financial Statements of Statutory Boards" (Uniformity Paper) when preparing their financial statements. The Uniformity Paper required Statutory Boards to follow the Statements of Accounting Standards (SAS) and provided guidelines for areas not covered by the SAS

In August 2002, the Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance (CCDG) was set up to take over the issuing of accounting standards from ICPAS. The standards issued by CCDG are known as the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (FRS).

An Advisory Committee was set by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to review and recommend accounting standards to be adopted by Statutory Boards in place of the SAS. Since then, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), through the Accountant-General's Department (AGD), issued finance circulars to prescribe accounting standards for SBs.

On 27 August 2007, the Accounting Standards Act 2007 ("Act") was passed and the Act came into effect on 1 November 2007. The Act established the Accounting Standards Council ("ASC") and appointed the Accountant-General as the legal authority to prescribe accounting standards for statutory boards.

Going forward, the SB-FRS will be issued by the Accountant-General for Statutory Boards via this website.
